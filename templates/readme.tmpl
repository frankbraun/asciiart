## Parsing hierarchical ASCII art for fun and profit [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/frankbraun/asciiart?status.png)](http://godoc.org/github.com/frankbraun/asciiart) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frankbraun/asciiart.png)](https://travis-ci.org/frankbraun/asciiart)

This is **alpha** software and the API is still in flux.


### Motivation

All ASCII art converters I know combine the ASCII parser and the graphics
generator into one package. This project started with the observation that
some ASCII art artifacts are *hierarchical* (often they comprise a *tree*) and
that it might be cool to have an abstract syntax tree (AST) of the parsed
ASCII art to use in *different* backends, a SVG generator just being one of
them.

The vision is to allow [model-oriented programming](https://github.com/imatix/gsl#model-oriented-programming) with hierarchical ASCII art as the modeling language...


### API example

```go
{{template "exampleprog.tmpl" .}}```


#### Output

```
{{.Output}}```


### Converting to SVG with `aa2svg`

This package also contains the tool `aa2svg` which uses the AST given by ASCII
art parser to generate SVGs.


#### Installation

```
go get -v github.com/frankbraun/asciiart/cmd/aa2svg
```


#### Usage

```
{{.Usage}}```


#### Example output
![Example SVG](https://rawgit.com/frankbraun/asciiart/master/templates/exampleart.svg)

Appending the following global reference to the ASCII art disables the blur
effect:

```
[_SVG]: {"blur": false}
```		


#### Elements in ASCII art

```
{{template "elements.tmpl"}}```


#### Elements as SVG

### Credits

This package was inspired by [ASCIIToSVG](https://github.com/dhobsd/asciitosvg/), the ASCII to SVG converter used to render the graphics in the
[ZeroMQ guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/).


### Open research question

How does one formally define a grammar for two-dimensional ASCII art?
ENBF doesn't seem to be up for the job...
